## It learnt from [here](https://github.com/CompleteBlenderCreator/08.Human.Bust)

### Section 8 Introduction ###

Michael Introduces The Human Head Section

Focus On 2 Main Topics
+ Mesh topology.
+ Material creation.

### Section 8 Reference Material ###

+ Drawn or photos are both OK.
+ They’re going to define your model. 
+ Guide and Influence your character. 
+ Just following along or without reference material will lead to frustration and a lot of wasted time.

### Good Mesh Topology ###

+ 2 Objects can have the same shape, yet a different mesh construction.
+ Use quads wherever possible. nGons and Triangles will cause pinching in your model.
+ Topology can determine how easy it is to edit or animate an object.
+ Topology defines a faces key shapes.
+ Edge/Face loops will follow features.
+ Loops will help with editing.
+ Loops will help with deformation / animation.

### Possible Construction Methods ###

+ Box Modelling: Building up the model from a primitive, adding detail as we go.
+ Poly to Poly: Building up your model one polygon at a time.
+ Sculpting and then Re-Topologising: Can be very time consuming

### Introduction To Retopology ###

+ You have probably already done it to some degree.
+ Remaking a mesh so that the arrangement of polygons is uniform and often all quads.
+ Can significantly lower the polygon count.
+ Planning can help avoid doing much of it.
+ Start low LOD and working up can help avoid it too.
+ It is time consuming.

**Do you Need to Retopologise?**

+ Almost always.
+ Planning can help avoid it.
+ If sculpting the original model it will be necessary.
+ Leads to a clean and well defined mesh.
+ Others can then work with your mesh too.
+ It enables animation possibilities.
+ Allows you to refine and easily edit your mesh.

### Creating The Base Mesh ###

+ You can Add Images as planes, this allows you to see the image all the time in the viewport.
+ Adding images as background images will only show the images when looking Top/bottom, Left/Right, Front Back and in orthographic view.
+ Create a base Mesh to start with and SaveAs when you reach a point where you can branch to make different models.

### The Grease Pencil ###

+ Making notes on your model.
+ Sketching and planning ideas.
+ Roughing out Shapes
+ Converted to edges
+ It can be use to create 2D Animations

### The Knife Tool ###

+ You'll learn how to use the knife tool.
+ See that it gives you many opportunities to craft and re-craft your model.
+ Understand that it can both ruin and fix your topology.

### Rip and Rip Fill ###

+ You'll learn how to use the Rip tool.
+ You’ll learn how to use the Rip Fill tool too!
+ Useful when you wish to add detail that otherwise would be difficult or time consuming to construct.

### Vertex Slide and Edge Slide ###

+ You'll learn about edge and vertex sliding.
+ See that it is a useful way of refining your model without having to create or remove existing geometry.

### Routing Face Loops Using Poles ###

+ You'll learn more about where poles are really useful.
+ How to use a pole to terminate edge/face loops.
+ How they can guide and redirect edge/face loops.
+ Remember a edge/face loop doesn’t have to link back to itself.

### Defining A Face's Main Face Loops ###

+ Define the 5 main face groups that make up the face.
+ Expect to make mistakes. Go with it and remember to Save often, and be prepared to start over from the base head.
+ Create the Nose

### Getting The Right Skin Tone ###

+ There aren’t any right settings
+ Skin is a complex surface.
+ It has more than one tone.
+ It’s shiny in some places, dry in others
+ Skin can be thin or thick letting some light through or blocking it all.

### 3 Point Lighting ###

+ My Scene Contains no direct lighting as of yet.
+ Lighting can change the feel and look of a scene.
+ A lot can be learnt from photo/videography.
+ When using Cycles lighting should be setup as it would be in the real world for best results.
+ 3 point lighting is a common lighting method.
+ 3 Lights: Key Light, Fill Light and Backlight.

### Subsurface Scattering ###

+ Light penetrates the surface of an object
+ Scattered in the material
+ Some light leaves the surface at a different point.
+ The more distance the light travels before exiting, the more it will be absorbed
+ Thicker areas will absorb more than thinner ones.
+ Most shaders we have used so far are direct surface scattering

### The Layer Weight Node ###

+ Usually used for controlling the weighting of shaders via the mix shader node.
+ The Fresnel output has a very sharp fall off.
+ The Facing output blends from one shader to the other more linearly.
+ Both depend on the angle of incidence of the surface in relation to the viewer/camera.

### Physics Based Rendering (PBR) ###

+ Render Time PBR is necessary for creating anything realistic.
+ Getting something looking like it does in the real world is critical to a lot of work.
+ Cycles is almost there, but is misses a few points
+ It doesn’t calculate Fresnel automatically and roughness can be tweaked to be more useable.

### The Color Ramp Node ###

+ The ColorRamp node is used for mapping values to colours with the use of a gradient.
+ It can be customised to produce interesting results.
+ We will be using it to control a single value so can stick with Grey scale.
+ Used to graphically control values.

### How Light Interacts With A Surface ###

+ Gain a better understanding of how light works in the real world and how that transfers into cycles.
+ Look at 6 ways that light and surfaces interact.
+ Gain some understanding about the physics behind how our materials are working.
+ We’re not going to get too deep into the math behind it!

### The Fresnel Node ###

+ Makes things more physically accurate.
+ Everything has a fresnel effect in the real world
+ Cycles doesn’t do it by default.
+ Low Roughness > High amount of Fresnel
+ High Roughness > Low amount of Fresnel

### Reusing Shaders And Materials ###

+ No longer will you have to keep making the same basic shaders again and again.
+ You’ll learn how to start your own library of shaders and materials.
+ Gives you the ability to continually improve your shaders and materials.

### The MixRGB Node ###

+ We’ll use it to mix 2 colours together.
+ See that it can be used to mix more that just colours together.
+ It accepts 6 channels in through 2 colour inputs and 3 channels out- mixing together the 2 colour inputs together based up a Blend type and factor.

### The Geometry Node ###

+ Use this node to take control of an object's normals.
+ You’ll see the vector coordinates we will observe are represented as WORLD Space normals
+ We shall use this node to control the amount of fresnel based upon the amount of roughness.

### Hue Saturation Value (HSV) ###

+ We’ll get to grips with what Hue Saturation and Value mean.
+ A HSV Value is a cylindrical representation of a point in RGB colour space.
+ Hue simply means colour/shade.
+ Saturation is how much there is of that colour.
+ Value can be considered like brightness.

### Making Objects Separately ###

+ We’re getting back to modelling.
+ We cannot fully texture our model until the modelling stage is complete.
+ We’ll take a look at the ear. - With all the folds it can be a challenge!
+ There are 2 main loops for the ear, the inner and outer one.
+ We’re going to make it separately in order to focus on the model.
+ Isolation can be a good and bad thing.

### Joining Separate Objects ###

+ We will join the 2 meshes together forming one mesh object
+ There is more than one way to do this.
+ It is likely to involve some re-topology.

### Adding Detail with Sculpting ###

+ We’ll see that detail can be added in various ways
+ Use the multiresolution modifier to create derived data.
+ Sculpt the rest of the facial detail we need.

**Other Options?**

+ Manually move the vertices about.
+ Add more vertices (ill advised)
+ An accomplished artist could potentially paint the detail straight away.

### UV Unwrapping A Head ###

+ Think about your seams.
+ Try and leave the face intact -without seams.
+ Discover any parts that need their own island

### Texturing The Head ###

+ We’ll make sure our seams are in the right place.
+ Connect our texture to the model.
+ Test to make sure it is working as expected

### Reviewing Your Work Objectively ###

+ We will take an objective look at our model and see what is missing.
+ First : Any Improvements to modelling
+ Second: Any improvements that need to be made to texturing.
+ Finally: Lighting and Environment
